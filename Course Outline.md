90T2704 – Administering SCCM (MECM) to achieve a unified architecture

5-Days

Course Overview
This is based on SCCM 2016 based on the 20703-1B.  Note: SCCM has been rebranded under a new suite of security tools called Microsoft Endpoint Manager.  This book explores SCCM (MECP) new Microsoft Endpoint Platform as announced.  It will be presented for the viewpoint of keeping SCCM (new name MECM) as the authoritative system and it does not include the integration or co-management features for cloud Management thru Microsoft EndPoint Manager, if interested in using SCCM, MECM for cloud management we recommend course 90T2704. Migrate to Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager is optional, and although integration with Windows Intune might not be required for On-Premises and Disconnected management as this book covers, every organization can benefit from those features. You also will learn how to optimize System Center Endpoint Protection, manage compliance, and create management queries and reports.  We will also discuss the benefits of WUfB.
